## The Pitch (One Sentence)
> An AI co-pilot powered by Amazon Bedrock that gives insurance Relationship Managers instant, citation-backed answers during live client calls — replacing 10-15 minutes of manual search with a 1.8-second RAG query.

---

## Business Context

### What We're Proving with This Demo
1. **Technical feasibility** — Real RAG on AWS Bedrock works within the 2-second SLA
2. **UX viability** — The interface fits into an RM's live-call workflow naturally
3. **Compliance value** — AI can detect conflicting clauses that humans miss under pressure
4. **ROI potential** — 30-45 minutes saved per RM per day is measurable and significant

### Primary Audience: AWS Bootcamp Stakeholders
- **Context**: PIA (Partner Innovation Accelerator) Bootcamp — AWS-organized
- **Goal**: Impress AWS and partner stakeholders with a working, realistic demo
- **Evaluation criteria**: Technical use of AWS services + real business problem + polished execution
- **Duration**: ~10-minute demo presentation

### Secondary Audience: Insurance Firm Decision-Makers (future)
- FinServe Analytics team / Italian insurance firm leadership
- They need to see ROI, compliance value, and user adoption potential
- They are NOT the demo day audience today

## Decision Log

### BD-001 — Demo scope is Phase 0 only
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Decision**: This build is scoped to Phase 0 (demo) — no production backend, no real authentication, no persistence.
**What this means**:
- Mock authentication (hardcoded users)
- No database — all state is in-memory or static JSON
- Synthesized insurance documents (not real PDFs)
- AWS Bedrock is the only "real" infrastructure
**Rationale**: 1-2 day timeline. Goal is to validate the concept and win the bootcamp, not to ship to production.
**Status**: FINAL

---

### BD-002 — AWS services as differentiator
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Decision**: Lean into AWS Bedrock as the explicit technical differentiator in the demo narrative.
**What to highlight**:
- "This is running on Amazon Bedrock — Claude 3 via the Bedrock API"
- "Embeddings generated by Amazon Titan Embeddings V2"
- "Architecture designed to scale to Bedrock Knowledge Bases post-demo"
**Rationale**: Demo audience is AWS stakeholders. Showing native AWS usage scores points. Positions the product as cloud-ready.
**Status**: FINAL

---

### BD-003 — Internal tool framing (not SaaS)
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Decision**: Frame the demo as an internal tool for a specific insurance firm, not a multi-tenant SaaS product.
**Rationale**: Simpler story, more relatable to insurance firm stakeholders. Multi-tenancy is a Phase 3 concern.
**Status**: FINAL (for demo)

---

### BD-004 — Italian language is a feature, not a detail
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Decision**: Prominently surface the Italian language capability in the demo — it's a differentiator, not just a localization detail.
**Framing**: "The AI understands insurance context AND responds natively in Italian — no translation layer, no quality loss."
**Demo moment**: The compliance scenario response in Italian is the most impressive moment to let land.
**Status**: FINAL

## Value Proposition (Quantified)

| Metric | Before AI | With AI | Gain |
|--------|-----------|---------|------|
| Query response time | 10-15 min | 1.8 sec | ~99% faster |
| RM time savings | — | 30-45 min/day | ~1 FTE efficiency per 10 RMs |
| Compliance flags caught | Depends on RM | Auto-detected | 100% detection target |
| Customer hold time | 10-15 min | <30 sec | NPS impact |
| New RM ramp time | 6-12 months | Shorter | Training cost reduction |

## KPIs for Demo Day Success

- [ ] Stakeholders ask "when can we use this for real?"
- [ ] Real Bedrock response demonstrated live (not pre-recorded)
- [ ] Compliance flag scenario lands clearly
- [ ] Italian language capability is noticed and remarked upon
- [ ] Response time is visibly under 2 seconds on screen

## Open Business Questions (Post-Demo)

- [ ] Budget approved for LLM API costs (per month)?
- [ ] Which insurance firm is the initial customer?
- [ ] Is this sold as a product, or built as an internal tool?
- [ ] Timeline and team for Phase 1 MLP?
- [ ] What's the compliance review process for AI-generated insurance advice?
- [ ] Data residency requirements (EU data protection for Italian users)?
